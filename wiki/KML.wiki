#summary KML handling in OSMBonusPack.

= Introduction =

OSMBonusPack implements a subset of KML features. 

From an end-user point of view: 
 * Anything you can do with Google Maps Engine LITE (the Web) is supported. 
 * But if you created your KML content with advanced tools like Google Earth or ArcGIS, then find below the details of what is supported.

= Limits =

There is no hard-coded limit in the lib, for instance on the number or level of folders, number of placemarks, number of coordinates, and so on. 
So the only technical limit will be the memory heap. 

Unfortunately, on Android, memory heap available to an application is small: around 50Mb - when it can be 1Gb or more on a PC. 
As OSMBonusPack handles KML entirely in memory, this limit is the key. 

You can reasonnably plan to manipulate KML files up to 1Mb (loading, displaying, editing, saving).
