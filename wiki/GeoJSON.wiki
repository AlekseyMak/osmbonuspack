#summary Support of GeoJSON.

_GeoJSON saving is available. GeoJSON loading is on its way and will be available from v4.2.9. _

= Mapping between GeoJSON types and KML classes =


|| *GeoJSON type* || *OSMBonusPack class* ||
|| FeatureCollection || KmlFolder ||
|| Feature || KmlPlacemark ||
|| Point || KmlPoint ||
|| LineString || KmlLineString ||
|| Polygon || KmlPolygon ||


At loading, other GeoJSON types will be ignored. 
At saving, other KML classes will be ignored. 

If your KmlFolder contains recursively other KmlFolder, the resulting GeoJSON could be invalid. 
Surprisingly, GeoJSON doesn't seem to support multiple levels of FeatureCollection. 

= GeoJSON properties, KML attributes and ExtendedData =

KML "name" attribute is handled (at loading and saving) as the property "name". 
Exemple: 
"properties": {"name" : "New-York city"}

All other GeoJSON properties are loaded as ExtendedData. 
KML ExtendedData are saved as GeoJSON properties. 
And other KML attributes like description, or style information, are not saved in GeoJSON.
