#summary Support of GeoJSON.

= Mapping between GeoJSON and KML classes =


 || GeoJSON type || OSMBonusPack class ||
 || FeatureCollection || KmlFolder ||
 || Feature || KmlPlacemark ||
 || Point || KmlPoint ||
 || LineString || KmlLineString ||
 || Polygon || KmlPolygon ||

Other GeoJSON types are not supported. 
And other KML classes cannot be saved in GeoJSON. 

Surprisingly, GeoJSON doesn't seem to support multiple levels of FeatureCollection. If your KmlFolder contains recursively other KmlFolder, the resulting GeoJSON could be invalid.
