#summary Accessing OSM data, as POI or as KML.

= Introduction =
Overpass API is a super-powerful search API directly accessing to OpenSteetMap data. 

OverpassAPIProvider gives you access to this API through 2 flavors: either using the simple "POI" approach, or using the KML flavor to get full geometry and tags.

It combines the power of OverpassAPI query language, with the power of KML  representation. 

OverpassAPIProvider#urlForTagSearchKml(String tag, BoundingBoxE6 bb, int limit, int timeout) is a helper method to build a request for a simple tag search. 

OverpassAPIProvider#addInKmlFolder(KmlFolder kmlFolder, String url) performs the query, and convert the result to KML content:
  * OSM Nodes are converted to KML Point. 
  * OSM Ways: open ways are converted to KML LineString, closed ways are converted to KML Polygon. 
  * OSM Relations are converted to KML MultiGeometry. 

Some use cases: 
  * Get cinemas => urlForTagSearchKml("amenity=cinema", bb, limit, timeout);
  * Get all kind of shops => urlForTagSearchKml("shop", bb, limit, timeout);
  * Get buildings => urlForTagSearchKml("building", bb, limit, timeout);
  * Get all features having "website" tag => urlForTagSearchKml("website", bb, limit, timeout);

For more complex searches, you can have a look at #urlForTagSearchKml, and then build your own OverpassAPI request. To use #addInKmlFolder, your request must ensure that: 
  * Content is in JSON format
  * ways and relations have the "geometry" element
