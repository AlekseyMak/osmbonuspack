#summary About Downloads location

Following new Google code plan, to block the standard Downloads feature, the project downloads are now hosted in the Source tab, in a dedicated project <a href="http://code.google.com/p/osmbonuspack/source/browse/#svn%2FBonusPackDownloads">BonusPackDownloads</a>. 

This is the less bad option we found (after experiencing the Google Drive option, which was just irrelevant when using an Android device to download an application...). 

Better ideas will be welcomed.
