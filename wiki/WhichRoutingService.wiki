#Choosing a routing service. 

= Introduction =

So now, with this Bonus Pack, you can switch between routing services by just calling the right RoadManager. 
But choosing the right routing service may not be so simple. 
Find here some elements to help you in this choice. 

= Performance = 
On a 350km trip (in France, Rennes-Paris), the duration of an end-to-end route retrieval (including full parsing of server response) is, on an average of 5 requests: 
 * With MapQuest Open API: 6 seconds (5s min, 7s max)
 * With Google Directions API: 1.6s (1.5s min, 1.9s max)
 * With OSRM demo site: 0.8s (0.4s min, 1.2s max)
Yes, OSRM is incredibly fast!


= OSRM Issues =
 * Some start/end points "in the green" will lead to no-route answer
 * The set of available directions is a little bit short. No "Enter/merge", or "Take exit lane on the left/on the right" for instance. 
 * Waypoints are taken into account in route shape, but not in nodes. 

OSRM is quite new and very active project, these issues should be fixed soon. 

= MapQuest issues =
 * Route is ending "one node too far". This is probably intentional, to give indications if the driver went too far. But not easy to hide.
