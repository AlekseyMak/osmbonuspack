#summary Why this BonusPack, and what does it give.

OSMDroid provides an simple and efficient way to move an application from Google Maps to OpenStreetMap. OSMDroid provides:
  * the map tiles (MapView) and the usual zoom/pan tools (MapController)
  * the standard overlays (ItemizedOverlay, MyLocationOverlay,...)
  * and some additional overlays (MinimapOverlay, PathOverlay,...)

However, in most map-based applications, we want more!
So, here comes OSMDroidBonusPack . 

= Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding =
Android provides the [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Geocoder.html Geocoder] class. BUT... according to Google Maps APIs Terms of Service, it can only be used in relation with a Google map. 
(see https://developers.google.com/maps/terms, item (g): No Use of Content without a Google Map)

So, OSMDroidBonusPack provides GeocoderNominatim class, which accesses to Nominatim service: 
 * OSM Nominatim
 * MapQuest Nominatim
 * or any other Nominatim-compliant service. 
Migrating from Android Geocoder is a simple change of class name. 

= Routes and Directions = 
OSMDroidBonusPack provides a set of classes to get routes, with turn-by-turn information and route shape:
 * RoadManagers retrieve roads from a variety of services providers. Currently supported: 
  * [http://open.mapquestapi.com/guidance/ MapQuest Open Guidance] service
  * and [http://project-osrm.org/ OSRM]. 

 * Result is a "Road" object, containing: 
  * road shape, as a list of GeoPoint => RoadManager can build an osmdroid PathOverlay from this road shape, ready-to-display. 
  * turn-by-turn information, as a list of RoadNode
 * Also provided, some route-related utilities: 
  * a polyline encoder/decoder
  * a polyline reducer based on Douglas-Peucker algorithm. 


= Cartoon-bubble Overlays =
The InfoWindow class is a view that can be displayed on an OSMDroid map, associated to a GeoPoint. 
Typical usage is to have cartoon-like bubble displayed when clicking an overlay item. 
The API mimics the [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#InfoWindow InfoWindow] class of Google Maps JavaScript API V3. 

A NinePatch background and a standard layout are provided in the demo application. Contributors are strongly encouraged to provide some nice alternatives... 

ItemizedOverlayWithBubble is an overlay that will open an InfoWindow bubble when the user taps on an item. ItemizedOverlayWithBubble can easily replace (and enhance) the ItemizedOverlayWithFocus of osmdroid. 


= Map events handling = 
MapEventsOverlay and MapEventsReceiver classes provide a simple way to manage single-press and long-press events somewhere on the map. 

Example: long-press on the map to define the destination, a new POI,...
