#summary Why this "OSMBonusPack", and what does it give.

osmdroid is an opensource library which provides an simple and efficient way to move an application from Google Maps to OpenStreetMap. osmdroid provides:
  * the map tiles (MapView) and the usual zoom/pan tools (MapController)
  * the standard overlays (ItemizedOverlay, MyLocationOverlay,...)
  * and some additional overlays (MinimapOverlay, PathOverlay,...)

However, in most map-based applications, we want more!
So, here comes OSMBonusPack. 

= Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding =
Android provides the [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Geocoder.html Geocoder] class. BUT... according to Google Maps APIs Terms of Service, it can only be used in relation with a Google map. 
(see https://developers.google.com/maps/terms, item (g): No Use of Content without a Google Map)

So, OSMBonusPack provides GeocoderNominatim class, which accesses to Nominatim service: 
 * the standard OpenStreetMap [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim Nominatim] service
 * the Nominatim service hosted by [http://developer.mapquest.com/web/products/open/nominatim/ MapQuest]
 * or any other Nominatim-compliant service (your own for instance). 
Migrating from Android Geocoder is a simple change of class name. 

= Routes and Directions = 
OSMBonusPack provides a set of classes to get routes, with turn-by-turn information and route shape:

RoadManagers retrieve roads from a variety of service providers. Currently supported: 
  * [http://open.mapquestapi.com/guidance/ MapQuest Open Guidance] service
  * and [http://project-osrm.org/ OSRM]. 

Result is a "Road" object, containing: 
  * the road shape, as a list of GeoPoint => RoadManager can build an osmdroid PathOverlay from this road shape, ready-to-display. 
  * turn-by-turn information, as a list of RoadNode

Also provided, some route-related utilities: 
  * a polyline encoder/decoder
  * a polyline reducer based on Douglas-Peucker algorithm. 


= Overlays with cartoon-bubble =
The InfoWindow class is a view that can be displayed on an OSMDroid map, associated to a GeoPoint. 
Typical usage is to have cartoon-like bubble displayed when clicking an overlay item. 
The API mimics the [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#InfoWindow InfoWindow] class of Google Maps JavaScript API V3. 

Two standard bubble layouts are provided in the demo application, each one with its NinePatch background. Contributors are strongly encouraged to provide some nice alternatives... 

ItemizedOverlayWithBubble is an overlay that will open an InfoWindow bubble when the user taps on an item. ItemizedOverlayWithBubble can easily replace (and enhance) the ItemizedOverlayWithFocus of osmdroid. 

= POIs =
OSMBonusPack gives a set of classes to get Points Of Interest (POIs).

POIProviders retrieve POI from a variety of service providers. 
Currently supported: 
 * Nominatim, to retrieve OpenStreetMap "features"
 * [http://www.geonames.org/export/wikipedia-webservice.html GeoNames Wikipedia] service, retrieving Wikipedia geolocalized entries

Result is a list of "POI" objects containing the position of the POI, and POI information. 

= Map events handling = 
MapEventsOverlay and MapEventsReceiver classes provide a simple way to handle single-press and long-press events somewhere on the map. 

Example: long-press on the map to define the destination, a new POI,...
