#summary BonusPack Tutorial #3: KML content.

= Using KML content =

[http://www.wikipedia.com/KML KML] is a de-facto standard for handling overlays on maps, from a simple list of markers, to complex structures. 

Both Google Maps and Bing Maps allow people to create their "personal maps" by putting markers, lines and polygons. Such personal maps can be exported as KML content. 
More advanced tools can be used to create and display KML content, like Google Earth or ArcGIS. 

OSMBonusPack provides the basic toolbox to handle KML content.
